# Loiza

#Loiza is a project to create a cozy game based on Puerto Rico and its culture. Specifically, we are aiming to represent the life in one of the more, yet culturally rich areas of Puerto Rico: Loiza. 

#What would it mean to start again somewhere that is both familiar and alien to you? In this game, you inherit an old bar in the beaches of Loiza. You are surrounded by a colorful cast of locals that you can befriend or betray in your quest to develop your store. 

#LOIZA will be a Unity based game
